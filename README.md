# AdventOfCode2018
My solutions created in Java for the Advent of Code. 

Day 1)

Part 1:


Here are some example situations:

+1, +1, +1 results in  3
+1, +1, -2 results in  0
-1, -2, -3 results in -6

Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?

Part 2:

Here are examples:

+1, -1 first reaches 0 twice.
+3, +3, +4, -2, -4 first reaches 10 twice.
-6, +3, +8, +5, -6 first reaches 5 twice.
+7, +7, -2, -7, -4 first reaches 14 twice.

What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?
